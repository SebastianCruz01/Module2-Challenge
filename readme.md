# Portfolio Project

A portfolio of work goes a long way for employers. A portfolio is evidence
you know what you are doing and can also really highlight your strengths. Students who follow through and work on their portfolio really do have the advantage and a have the higher likelyhood of getting a phone call back. The more projects you have on the website, that % can only go up. 

In this challenge, we invest in ourselves and create a portfolio using the several skills we have learned in HTML and CSS. 

# User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

# Mock-Up
